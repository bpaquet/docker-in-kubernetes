# docker-in-kubernetes — Design

## Goal

A Go program that exposes a Docker-compatible HTTP API on a UNIX socket. When a user sets `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///path/to/docker-in-kubernetes.sock`, the standard `docker` CLI transparently drives pods on the user's currently-configured Kubernetes cluster instead of a local Docker daemon.

Primary use case: `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis` creates a Pod on the cluster and forwards `localhost:6379` to the pod.

## Prior work

The idea has been attempted; nothing maintained covers the exact "unmodified Docker CLI → remote k8s" niche.

| Project | Overlap | Why it doesn't cover this |
|---|---|---|
| **k3c** (Darren Shepherd, ~2020) | Docker-like CLI on top of k8s, Docker-ish API | Archived, never reached parity, build-focused. Worth reading the source for protocol skeleton. |
| **Telepresence** | Local ↔ cluster bridging, SPDY port-forwarding | Inverse direction: local code talks to cluster services. Doesn't run `docker run` against a cluster. |
| **Okteto / DevSpace / Tilt / Skaffold** | "Dev loop in k8s" | All require their own manifests/config. None lets unmodified `docker run` work. |
| **nerdctl** | Docker-compatible CLI, k8s-aware namespaces | Backend is local containerd, not remote k8s. |
| **podman-remote** | Docker-compatible socket | Backend is podman; socket layer is reusable architecture inspiration. |
| **kompose** | docker-compose.yml → k8s YAML | Static translation, no runtime. |
| **kubectl run / debug** | One-shot "docker run"-like UX | No socket, no API, no `docker ps`. |
| **devpod** | Devcontainers on remote backends including k8s | Solves the workspace-sync problem we'd otherwise hit; useful prior art for the devcontainer angle. |

**Differentiator**: every tool that already speaks `DOCKER_HOST` (Testcontainers, IDE Docker integrations, `act`, CI helpers) should just work with zero config change. None of the above delivers that.

**Reusable Go libraries** — do not hand-roll:
- `github.com/docker/docker/api/types` — official Docker API JSON shapes so `inspect` matches byte-for-byte.
- `github.com/docker/docker/pkg/stdcopy` — multiplexed exec stream framing.
- `k8s.io/client-go/tools/portforward` — SPDY port-forward (already planned).

## Compatibility with Testcontainers and Devcontainers

Short version — informs scope; full matrix to be built as we implement.

### Testcontainers — mostly feasible, with sharp edges

A v1 plus a few additions can run the common Testcontainers modules (Redis, Postgres, Kafka). Additions needed beyond the v1 surface:

- `/containers/{id}/archive` (tar PUT/GET) for `withCopyFileToContainer` — proxy via exec+tar.
- `/networks/*` — no-op stubs (our namespace *is* the network).
- Random host-port allocation when `HostPort` is empty in `PortBindings`.
- Byte-accurate `inspect.NetworkSettings.Ports`.
- Stubbed `/images/create` (rely on cluster pull-on-create).

**Known blocker**: the **Ryuk reaper** container connects *back* to the Docker socket from inside the cluster — impossible when the socket lives on the user's laptop. Mitigation: require `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true`. Aligns with our "no cleanup on shim exit" stance.

### Devcontainers — not pursued

Two fundamental blockers:

1. **Workspace bind mount**: `devcontainer.json` mounts the laptop's source folder into the pod. A pod in a remote cluster can't see that filesystem without a sync layer (Mutagen / rsync sidecar). Out of scope.
2. **`docker build` and Features**: devcontainers leans heavily on build; we declared build out of scope.

`devpod` already solves this with its own provider abstraction. Users who need devcontainers-on-k8s should use that.

## First milestone

`docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis` works end-to-end against a real cluster:

1. `docker -H unix:///path/to/docker-in-kubernetes.sock run -d -p 6379:6379 redis` returns a container ID.
2. A Pod appears in the configured namespace, reaches `Ready`.
3. `redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 ping` returns `PONG`.
4. `docker ps` shows the container.
5. `docker logs <id>` streams the redis startup logs.
6. `docker rm -f <id>` deletes the pod and closes the forwarder.

`-it` (interactive + TTY), `docker exec`, `docker stop`/`start` round-trip, and Testcontainers compatibility are follow-up milestones.

## Container name sanitization

K8s pod names are RFC 1123: lowercase alphanumerics + `-`, max 63 chars. Docker `--name` is more permissive. Translation rule:

- Lowercase the input.
- Replace any character not in `[a-z0-9-]` with `-`.
- Collapse consecutive `-`, trim leading/trailing `-`.
- Truncate to 63 chars.
- Store the original `--name` in annotation `docker-in-kubernetes.io/docker-name` so `docker ps`/`inspect` round-trip the user's chosen name.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Image build/push/pull management (`docker build`, `docker pull`, `docker images`).
- Volume mounts (`-v`) and bind mounts.
- Networks (`docker network`).
- Compose, swarm, plugins.
- Restart policies beyond `Never`.
- Multi-container pods.
- Cleanup of pods on shim exit — pods persist; user is responsible.

```

The daemon implements a subset of the Docker Engine HTTP API. Each Docker container maps 1:1 to a Kubernetes Pod in a single configured namespace.

## API surface (v1)

Real Docker Engine HTTP API, enough that the unmodified `docker` CLI works for:

| Docker CLI                         | Engine endpoints                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker run -p -e --name -d`       | `POST /containers/create`, `POST /containers/{id}/start`                    |
| `docker ps`, `docker ps -a`        | `GET /containers/json`                                                      |
| `docker inspect`                   | `GET /containers/{id}/json`                                                 |
| `docker stop`, `docker kill`       | `POST /containers/{id}/stop`, `POST /containers/{id}/kill`                  |
| `docker rm`                        | `DELETE /containers/{id}`                                                   |
| `docker logs`                      | `GET /containers/{id}/logs`                                                 |
| `docker exec`                      | `POST /containers/{id}/exec`, `POST /exec/{id}/start`, `GET /exec/{id}/json`|
| `docker version`, `docker info`    | `GET /version`, `GET /info` (static-ish responses)                          |

API version: advertise `1.43` (Docker Engine 24.0) via `/_ping` `Api-Version` header and `/version`. Accept any `/v1.x` prefix and route to the same handlers. This covers the modern `docker` CLI's negotiation floor and Testcontainers' `>= 1.24` minimum without obliging us to implement post-1.43 endpoints.

## Container ↔ Pod mapping

- **1 container = 1 Pod**, single container inside the pod.
- **Pod name**: `--name` if provided; otherwise a generated slug (e.g. `docker-in-kubernetes-redis-a1b2`).
- **Docker container ID**: Pod's `metadata.uid` (UUID, hex-stripped → first 12 chars for short ID).
- **Pod spec**:
  - `restartPolicy: Never`
  - One container, image = Docker image as-is
  - `env` ← `-e`
  - `ports` ← `-p` (containerPort only; host port handled by port-forward, see below)
- **Labels** (used by `ps` to find "our" pods):
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/managed=true`
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/container-name=<docker name>`
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/project=<project>` (defaults to `default`; reserved for Compose v2)
- **Annotations**:
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/created-at=<RFC3339>`
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/image=<original image string>`
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/ports=<json of -p mappings>`
  - `docker-in-kubernetes.io/env=<json of -e>` (for `docker inspect` fidelity)

## Port forwarding

docker-in-kubernetes picks one of two forwarder backends at startup, based on whether it runs inside the cluster.

**Mode detection**: presence of `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` env var → in-cluster mode (also triggers `rest.InClusterConfig()` for k8s auth). Otherwise → local mode.

### Local mode (laptop)

- In-process port-forward using `k8s.io/client-go/tools/portforward` over SPDY (no `kubectl` dependency).
- For every `-p HOST:CONTAINER` on `docker run`, the daemon:
  1. Waits for the pod to reach `Ready`.
  2. Opens a port-forward goroutine binding `127.0.0.1:HOST → pod:CONTAINER` via the apiserver.
  3. Tracks the forwarder in an in-memory map keyed by container ID.

### In-cluster mode (docker-in-kubernetes running as a pod)

- No SPDY port-forward — the docker-in-kubernetes pod has direct network access to other pods in the cluster.
- For every `-p HOST:CONTAINER`, the daemon:
  1. Waits for the pod to reach `Ready` and have a `PodIP`.
  2. Starts a plain TCP proxy goroutine: `Listen(127.0.0.1:HOST) → Dial(podIP:CONTAINER)`.
  3. Tracks the proxy in the same in-memory map.
- Listener always binds `127.0.0.1` inside the docker-in-kubernetes pod (matches local-mode semantics; reachable only from inside the docker-in-kubernetes pod).
- Lower overhead, no apiserver round-trip per byte, no SPDY framing.

### Common

- On `stop`/`kill`/`rm`, the forwarder is cancelled regardless of mode.
- Forwarders are **not** restored across daemon restarts in v1 (pods persist, forwards do not). Re-running `docker start` would re-establish. See [Later](#later-deferred-features) for the planned auto-rebuild.

## Lifecycle

| Docker verb | What docker-in-kubernetes does                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`    | Build Pod spec, `POST` it. Pod is scheduled immediately. Wait for `Ready` and open port-forwards. |
| `start`     | Same as `create`. If the container already exists and is running, no-op. (See note below.) |
| `stop`      | `DELETE` Pod with graceful `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 10s). Close forwards. |
| `kill`      | `DELETE` Pod with `gracePeriodSeconds=0`. Close forwards.                  |
| `rm`        | Same as `kill` if running; no-op if pod already gone.                      |
| `logs`      | Stream from `GET /api/v1/namespaces/{ns}/pods/{name}/log?follow=true`.     |
| `exec`      | `POST .../pods/{name}/exec` SPDY stream, proxied through Docker's exec protocol. |

**Lifecycle simplification (decided)**: k8s has no "stopped pod" state, so we collapse Docker's two-phase model:

- `create` and `start` are equivalent: both schedule the pod and open forwards. `docker run` (create+start) works as expected.
- `start` on an already-running container is a no-op.
- `stop` deletes the pod — there is no "stopped" container. `docker ps -a` will not show stopped containers; once deleted, gone.
- `start` on a previously-stopped (i.e., deleted) container returns an error: container not found.

This trades fidelity for simplicity. Users who want restart semantics use `docker run` again.

## State

- **No persistent state in the daemon.** All truth lives in the k8s API server.
- `ps` lists pods with label `docker-in-kubernetes.io/managed=true` in the configured namespace.
- Port-forwarders are in-memory only; lost on daemon restart.

## Configuration

CLI flags:

- `--socket` (default `/tmp/docker-in-kubernetes.sock`): UNIX socket path
- `--namespace` (required): k8s namespace for all pods
- `--kubeconfig`: path to kubeconfig (default: `KUBECONFIG` env, else `~/.kube/config`)
- `--context`: kubeconfig context (default: current context)

When `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` is set, docker-in-kubernetes uses in-cluster config and ignores `--kubeconfig`/`--context`.

## Forward compatibility: Docker Compose (v2, not implemented yet)

v1 must not foreclose Compose support. Decisions taken now to leave the door open:

- **Service discovery via namespace**: Because docker-in-kubernetes runs in a single dedicated namespace (`--namespace`), in-cluster DNS already provides cross-pod resolution (`<podname>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local`, or `<podname>` from within the same ns once a headless Service exists). v2 will add a headless Service per pod or a shared one; v1 does not need to model "networks" explicitly — the dedicated namespace *is* the network.
- **Project label on every resource**: every Pod (and future Service/PVC) carries `docker-in-kubernetes.io/project=<name>` (defaults to `default` for plain `docker run`). v2's `compose down` becomes a label-selector delete. v1 must already write this label so v2 can pick up pre-existing pods.
- **Volumes mapped to k8s storage**: named volumes → PVC (`docker-in-kubernetes-vol-<project>-<name>`), anonymous → `emptyDir`, host bind mounts → explicitly rejected with a clear error. Not implemented in v1, but the pod-spec builder is structured so a volume list can be slotted in without redesign.
- **depends_on / ordered startup**: deferred to v2.

These choices mean v1's pod labels and namespace assumption are forward-compatible; v2 layers Compose semantics on top without migrating existing resources.

## Later (deferred features)

Explicitly out of scope for v1, planned for later iterations. Listed here so v1 design choices keep them feasible.

### Auto-rebuild port-forwards on daemon startup

On startup, scan the configured namespace for pods with `docker-in-kubernetes.io/managed=true` in phase `Running`, read each pod's `docker-in-kubernetes.io/ports` annotation, and re-open every port-forward. Makes the daemon feel stateless from the user's view: restart `docker-in-kubernetes`, ports come back.

Behaviour to nail down when we implement it:

- **Port conflicts on rebuild**: if `127.0.0.1:HOST` is already taken, log + skip that single forwarder; do not abort startup.
- **Pod phase filter**: only `Running` pods get forwards rebuilt. `Pending`/`Succeeded`/`Failed` are listed by `ps` but get no forward until a `docker start`.
- **Partial failures**: one pod's failure must not block the others — log and continue.

### Docker Compose compatibility (v2)

See [Forward compatibility: Docker Compose](#forward-compatibility-docker-compose-v2-not-implemented-yet) for the v1 design choices that keep this open (project label, namespace = network, volume scheme). The actual implementation — parsing `docker-compose.yml`, `compose up/down/ps`, `depends_on` ordering — is v2.

### Other open questions

- Cleanup on exit. Lease-based GC is the most idiomatic if/when we add it.
- `-v` volumes → `emptyDir` / hostPath / PVC.
- `--restart` flag mapping.
- Multi-arch images, private registries with `imagePullSecrets`.
- Concurrent port allocation collisions (two `docker run -p 6379:...` calls).
- TLS/auth on the UNIX socket (currently relies on filesystem perms).
